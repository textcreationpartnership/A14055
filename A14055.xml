            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>RYght myghtye princes &amp; honorable lordes, thys haue I marked in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of Germani: that after that the burgeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes and cytezenes haue bylded them cyties, and haue made good and hol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſome lawes for the maintenaunce of all kynde of good order there: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue choſen vnto them certeine lordes whyche they call in theyr tounge Schermheeren, that is, defendyng lordes, to defende theyr cities, when as they are perfytlye bylded and ſet in good order: Knowyng wel by ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perience, that there is no cytie ſo
<pb facs="tcp:19362:3"/> ſtrongly bylded and well ordered, but it ſhal haue enuyers and mortal enemyes at one tyme or other.</p>
            <p>Euen ſo I, after that I had made thys lytle boke, and ſet it in as good order as I coulde, fearyng, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precyſlye knowynge, that there ſhall many aryſe, whych wyl either ſlaunder it, and blame it, or els wyl condemne it and burne it, as an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall and ſeditius booke: before they haue caſte and reproued it by any ſufficient wytneſſes, ether of ſcripture, or of reaſon, amonge all the hole nobilite of Englande, I am compelled by great nede to chuſe you, and deſyre you to be patrones, and defenders of this my lytle boke onely ſo farre as it agreeth with na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural reaſon, and wyth the wrytten worde of God. Yf that any wiſe and learned man can reproue and iuſtly ouercome any thynge that I haue wrytten in thys booke, wyth reaſon and ſcripture, I wyll amende it that is amyſſe: and recant it whyche is wrytten agaynſt the ſcripture. But yf no ſuche thynge can be founde in it: I beſeche you as Goddes mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and officers vnder hym, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
<pb facs="tcp:19362:3"/> it ſo longe as it ſhalbe founde reaſonable and godly. But leſte, I ſhuld put you, vnto to muche paine: I wyll aunſwere aforehand to ſum obiections, whych I reken wyll be made agaynſt me. Some who wold be loth that theyr ſores ſhulde be tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched: wyll ſaye, why do ye not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute as well to heale the clergye, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mones, as ye go aboute nowe to correcte vs? There is neither of bothe thoſe orders, but it hadde as muche nede of Phyſike, as the nobi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lite hath. I aunſwere that yf the clergye be ſik, the nobilite ought to be their phiſicianes and healers.</p>
            <p>Howe can the nobilite heale them: when they are ſik them ſelues?</p>
            <p>Howe ſhall the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mones be healed, when as their phyſicians in politike thynges, the noble men: and theyr phyſicianes in ſpirituall matters, the ſhepherdes are bothe ſo ſik, that they are not able to do theyr owne duties? Therfore it is not poſſible to heale the other two orders, excepte the order of gentylmen be fyrſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Forthermore, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I intende to intreate of diuerſe matters, after the order of phyſike: what a foolyſhe
<pb facs="tcp:19362:4"/> Phyſician ſhulde I haue bene, yf that I ſhulde beſelye haue gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute to heale the legges and the thyghes, and not offered any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye at all, vnto the harte, the lyuer, and the hede? When as all phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſik wolde that the principall partes ſhulde be fyrſt loked to, and healed, becauſe all the proſperite and health of the lower partes, hange vpon the health and welfare of the ouer and principall partes, and the nether partes muſte nedes be ſike, as long as the ouer partes are not perfytlye healed. Thys matter is proued to be true, not only by phyſik and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reaſon,<note place="margin">Eccl. 10.</note> but alſo by the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture whyche ſayeth. Eccle, 10. As the gouerner of the cytie is: ſo are alſo they that dwell in it. Then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge that theſe gentylmen wyll be the principall partes, and the hede of the common wealth: acording vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to reaſon and to nature, they muſte go before all the reſte in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, whyche thinge they can not do, yf they be not healed before.</p>
            <p>Therfore it is neceſſary that the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemen be fyrſte healed. Where in,
<pb facs="tcp:19362:4"/> when I haue done as muche as I can do for my parte: I wyll offer ſome phyſike both vnto the clergye, and to the yemanry of thys realme, leſte I ſhulde ſeme to fauour one kynde of men more then an other. Yf any man thynke that I diſhonor your lordſhippes in dedicatyng my boke vnto you, and in ſpeakynge vnto you and to other lordes, in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny places of the booke: as thoughe ye were onely the ſik men to whom I offer phyſik onely to: I aunſwere that therin, I dyſhonour you not, but honor you as muche as lyeth in me, whilſe I make you the heade of all the nobilite in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quene. For when as ye are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heade of the bodye of the nobilite, it were no wyſedome for me to ſpeake vnto the ſik belly fete and backe, whyche for lacke of eares can hear nothing at all. When a man hath the goute in his too, or the ciatica in hys huc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kell bone, or the collik in hys bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, no wyſe phyſician wyll ſpeake vnto the too, nether vnto the huk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kell bone, nether vnto the bellye,
<pb facs="tcp:19362:5"/> but he ſpeaketh vnto the heade, whych heareth and receyueth coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and phyſik alſo, for all the reſte of the partes of the hole bodye, and thoughe theſe aboue named partes be onely vexed, and the hede be hole and ſounde, yet God and nature haue ordeyned, that the hede ſhall bothe receyue all maner of counſel, &amp; medicines, be they neuer ſo bitter &amp; vgly, for the vyleſt parte of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dye. Therfore I diſhonor not your lordſhips but honor you, as mych as lyeth in me whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I do none other wyſe vnto you, then God and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re wolde that I ſhulde do. Thys in moſte humble wyſe I beſeche your lordſhippes for the loue that ye owe vnto God, and to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth of Englande that ye loke well vpon my phyſik, and trye it to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte, yf ye fynde it lawfull, then take it vnto you, and into you, and diſpoſe it, and ſende it to ſuche par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the bodye of the nobilite as ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue moſte nede of it, and I dout not, but that many that are nowe ſicke ſhalbe well healed, to the glorye of God, and to the profyt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

            <p>THe loue that I owe vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to my Lorde God, to my neyghbor, and my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall countre, hathe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled me at thys tyme, to offer vnto you, my lordes &amp; may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſome parte of ſuche ſubſtance, as almyghtye God hath geuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. Whyche thynge, excepte I ſhould haue done, I might haue ben eaſely proued, nether to haue loued God, nor my neyghbour nor my countre. He that hath the ſubſtance of thys worlde, and ſeeth hys bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wantyng helpe, and ſhutteth vp his bowels from him, how doth the loue of God abide in him? How can he loue god whom he ſeeth not, whiche loueth not his neighbour, whome he ſeeth? How loueth he his neighbour that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he may ſaue &amp; helpe him, wil nether help him, nor offer any help to him at al? How lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth he his naturall countre, which ſuffreth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poſtes &amp; pillers of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tre (w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the which his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tre muſt
<pb facs="tcp:19362:10"/> nedes be deſtroyed) for lack of helpe to peryſhe, when as he can helpe them yf he wil? Then when as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God hath indued me with the knowlege of ſpirituall Phiſick and ſe my brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and countre me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the noble and gentyl men of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, ſore ſyck and lyke to peryſhe, except they haue ſpedye remedye, wolde offer them no helpe, I might iuſtly be iuged nether to loue God, my neighbour nor my countre.</p>
            <p>Therfore for the declaracion of my loue vnto all thre I intende accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto my bound deutie, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you ſome of my ſpirituall Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, whiche God hathe lent me, to heale ſuche diſeaſes as ye are ſick in When as of late yeares I practiſed bodely phiſick in Englande, in my lorde of Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merſettes houſe, diuers ſick beggers came vnto me, &amp; not knowyng that I was a Phiſician, aſked of me myne almoſe. To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I offered to heale their diſeaſes for Goddes ſake. But they went by and by awaye from me, and wolde none of that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For they had muche leuer be ſick ſtyll with eaſe and yd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenes, then to be hole, &amp; with great
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19362:10"/> payne and labour, to earne honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theyr lyuing. It were great ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, if any noble man or gentle ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhuld be lyke vnto a lyther begger, as all they are doutles (yf there be any ſuche) which had leuer be ſicke in a death bringing diſeaſe, that for a tyme they might haue their eaſe &amp; pleaſure then to be healed and to do their office with labour and paine, where vnto almightye God hathe called them. Other that are ſore ſick wil not knowlege that they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſicknes at all, and therfore wyll byd me beſtowe my phiſick vpon them that nede it. As for the former kynde, I will offer them phiſick, yf thei wil not receiue it, I am diſchar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged, and to their ieopardy be it. As for the other kynde that ſaye that they are not ſick, and pretend that yf they knewe ſurely that thei were ſick, wolde both ſeke remedye for their diſeaſes, and wolde thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye receyue ſuche remedies, as are offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I wil proue by good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorite and reaſon that thei are ſick, although thei do not, nor ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue and ſe their owne ſicknes.</p>
            <p>A ſicknes is a paſſion in a bodye, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:19362:11"/> nature, hurting &amp; ſtoppinge the naturall worke of the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Then thei whoſe natural work is hyndered and ſtopped, by ſome paſſion againſt nature: are ſick.</p>
            <p>But many noble men and gentyll men in Englande do not their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall worke, that belongeth vnto their vocacion. Therfore there are many noble men and gentyll men ſick in England. To proue that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe gentle men and noble men in Englande do not their offices that belonge vnto them: it is required that I firſt tell, who is a noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or a gentil man, &amp; what is the office of a gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; how many workes and properties belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge vnto a noble or gentleman, and wherin hys offi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce ſtandeth. It is therfore neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſhewe what is a nobleman or a gentilma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe in thys boke I make ſo ofte mention of noble men and gentlemen, leſt ſome ſhuld not knowe, to whome I ordeyne &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thys phiſick: <hi>Nobilis</hi> in latine be tokeneth any gentilman what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer degre he be of, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he be aboue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, &amp; not only a Duke or ſuche gentilmen as are onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

A gentleman hath hys name of thys worde <hi>gens gentis,</hi> whych may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Englyſhe, a folk, a nacion, or a family, ſo that it appereth, that a gentleman is he, that is commed of ſome notable houſe, famely or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name: for gentlemen, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue their ſurnames, other of their fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mely or manſion houſes, where as they were borne. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſorte of men which are no gentlemen, in many countres, haue none other name of their folk or kin, but ſuche as they receyued of their Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when they are baptiſed: As it is in lowe Germany, and in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande: In low Germany where as I haue ben moſte, there is almoſte no man ſauyng gentlemen, that ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue any ſurname, or name of theyr famely or kynred. For the yemen are ether called by the townes that

            <p>Hetherto haue I onelye ſpoken of the etymologi of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of a noble man and a gentle man. Now wyll I deſcribe a gentleman as well as I can.

            <p>NOwe after that I haue tolde you what a gentil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is, and that it is God that maketh &amp; hath made all ryght gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, let vs ſe for what ende &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he made them, and whether a gentleman ſerueth for any purpoſe in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welthe or no, or he is but an ydle ſuperfluus and a dead parte of the politike bodye or no.</p>
            <p>And yf he be a parte of the bodye, whether is he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> belly, that waſteth all thynge, that the reſt of the bodye wynneth: or he is an arme that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth the body wyth hys ſtrength or the head that ſaueth it, wyth wit and learnyng or no. The common ſorte of gentlemen beleueth that God hath made them in vayne, and
<pb facs="tcp:19362:13"/> that they are bounde to do nothyng at all for their lyuyng that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, and that the proper office worke and callynge of a gentleman, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to hauk and to hunt, to dyce and to carde, to ſweare and to bragge, to pype ſynge and daunce, &amp; to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke fyne curſy, to banket &amp; to weare proude apparell, and to haue gorgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us houſes: The Philoſophers and wyſe men of the gentyls, whych by the lawe of nature that was wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hartes, knewe partlye the nature of god by his creatures: wyth one aſſent and agreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, holde that God made nothyng in vayne. The ſame thynge maye ye learne of the partes of a mans body, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in no parte is ſo lytle or ſmale, but it ſerueth for one purpoſe or other. As ye maye well learne of Galene the Phiſiciane, in hys boke that he wrote, of the vſe and office of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of a mans bodye: Then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the politike bodye of the common welthe ought to be lyke vnto the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turall bodye of man (whyche is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of ſome wyſe men y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſſe world) ther ought no part to be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> politik body without office: wherfore yf ye

Yf ye requyre ſcripture to proue it that I haue proued before by Philo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſophers and by reaſon, I wyl proue you by ſcripture that gentlemen ought to haue ſome worke and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealthe, and that they are not ordened of God to be id<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le and to haue no office, as many id<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le ruflers do beleue at thys tyme.</p>
            <p>Moſes ſayeth that God dyd ſe that all thynges that he made were very good. Then yf gentlemen be of god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des creation, they are very good for ſomthynge. Yf they be made good, and that for ſome good thyng, then are they not ordened for to be ydle and vnoccupied. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as almyghty God ſayd vnto Adam, in the ſweate of thy browes ſhalte thou eate thy breade, he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted no priuilege vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>empted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all labour for they were at the tyme of that curſe, as well in

Yf they haue a worke &amp; a vocacion, appointed vnto them, then thei are not wythout an office, then maye they not thinke that they are bound to do nothyng profitable for the reſt of the congregacion or politik body that they are of. When as Chriſte ſhall ſaye in the daye of iudgement, or in the ende of euery mans lyfe, gyue accompt of thy ſtewardſhip, ſhall the nobilite make no accompt at all? Yf gentlemen may be ydle, &amp; haue no worke nor office appointed them, then ſhall they not nede to make any accompt of their ſteward<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip.

            <p>Then they that are idle men and do no good, ſhall neuer enter into the kingdome of heauen, but God hath ordened heauen for gentlemen, for he wolde that all men ſhulde be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, therfore they are ordened to do good vnto the common wealth, and not to be ydle.

The tale was of one Ihoan of Low, the kynge of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes fool. Thys ſymple ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtode in a place where as many lordes &amp; other gentlemen cam by, but the ſely fool nether greted nor put of his hood to any of al the lordes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came by. The which thing a certein curtier of the kynges houſe ſeyng, rebuked y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fool ſharply &amp; bet him a lytle, and threat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned him, that he wolde whyp hym, except he wolde grete the nexte lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that he ſawe. Poore Iohn ſayd that he wolde gladly grete the nexte
<pb facs="tcp:19362:17"/> lordes that he ſawe, yf the curtier wolde tell hym, howe that he myght knowe a Lorde from an other man For he ſayd that he knewe not a lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de from an other man. Then quod the curtier, thou ſhall knowe lordes by theſe tokens. They weare veluet and haue golde vpon their cappes, and about their neckes. Well quoth the fool, I ſhal lexe token them as well as I kan. And vpon the nexte daye as ſoone as Iohn cam abrode he ſawe a great ſort of byſhoppes &amp; other lordes mules ſtandynge at the court gates, trapped with veluet &amp; coſtly trimmed wyth golde, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he remembring his leſſon, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> curtier had taught hym, ſtrayght waye as ſoone as he ſawe them, he went vnto them, and cryed a great whyle, to euery one after an other, gued daye my lorde, gued daye my lorde, euen vntyll the Curtier hys ſcolemaiſter, came oute &amp; ſawe hym making curteſy, and gretynge the mules. As ſoone as the foole ſawe hys ſcoolmaiſter, he ſaid vnto him. Am I not a good ſun nowe? Thou art mad, quoth the curtier, for theſe are mules &amp; no lordes. Why quoth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19362:17"/> the fool, but theſe weare veluet, and gold on their heades. The curtier bet, the fool, and bad him learne bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter to ken a lorde or els he ſayd he wolde whyp hym naked. And as they were talkynge, ſodenlye came rydyng towarde them the ſheryffe of Murra all in veluet, hauynge a cappe all full of golden agglettes.</p>
            <p>The fool ſtepped forth to mete him, and as ſoone as he came nere vnto hym he ſayd, gued day my lord and ye be not a mule. Some man wyll ſaye that the ſaynge or doynge of a foole, is but of ſmale ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to ouer throwe the opinion of many wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye yonge men, whyche deſcribe a lorde, or a gentle man onely by coſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye apparel. To whome I anſwere: <hi>Saepe etiam ſtultus fuit opportuna loquutus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, a fool oft tymes hath ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thynges to good purpoſe, or in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Dyd not Balaams Aſſe ſpeake wyſely at a certayne tyme? Well yf any man be greued that hys opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhulde be confuted wyth the ſayeng and doynge of a fool, let hym chuſe one of theſe two whether he wyll, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is, whether the fool in thys hys do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge dyd wyſely or foolyſhly. Yf he

Yf he played the ryght foole then is he a foole that taketh and greteth hym for a lorde whych not by learnynge and knowlege, but onely by coſtlye apparel differeth from an other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Well thus dyd the poore Scottiſhe foole, were it not pytie that manye wyſe Englyſhe men (as they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) ſhulde take and gret mules for lordes &amp; gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Is it not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one mule may at this day cary an other? Maſter Latemer thought ſo when ſyr Martin mydas rode to heare maſter Myles preache, &amp; ſayd when the ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was done, that hys mule was as wel abſolued as he.</p>
            <p>And as for buyldyng of coſtlye hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and trimmynge of them wyth coſtly hangynges and fayre wayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot, manye marchauntes vſe to do thoſe thynges, better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen do, and yet for all that, are no

Ezechias was .xxv. yeare olde, when he entred into the kyngdome of Iuda, &amp; he dyd it that was pleaſaunt in the ſyght of God. In the very fyrſt yeare and firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth of hys reygne, he opened the dores of the Lordes houſe, and he re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>payred them. And he brought Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and ſacrificers, and he ſet them together in the Gaſt ſtreate. And he ſayd vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Heare me o Leuites, and be you made holy, make cleane the houſe of the Lorde God of youre fathers, and take awaye al vnclen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes out of the holy ſanctuary. He brake downe the hygh places, &amp; bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned the ymages, and cut downe the groues, and brake the braſen ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t whych Moſes made, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael offered frankincenſe vnto it.

Thus dyd the good kynge Ezechias thynke, that it was the chief parte of his vocacion, to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtroye ydolatrye, and to ſet forth the true religion. The noble and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19362:22"/> gentleman kyng Ioſias, who as the holye worde of God beareth wytneſſe, dyd it that was ryghte in ſyght of the Lord, and walked in the wayes of hys father Dauid, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bowed to the ryght hande nor lefte hande, toke it to be the moſte principall parte of hys office, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye ydolatrye, and to ſet forthe, and to promote, the true religion and worde of God. And therfore when as he was but a boye of xvi. yeres of age. As the .xxxiii.

After that the kynge had hearde the wordes of the lawe: he rent hys clothes and commaunded Helkia and diuers other, ſayeng: go

            <p>Nowe Lorde God let thy worde be done which thou promyſed vnto my father Dauid.

Nay, for he could ſay them by herte wel enough. But for thys ende ſayd he ſo oft, teache me thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that it myghe pleaſe God to gyue hym the true vnderſtandynge of the ſcripture, that he myght or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hys lyfe accordynge vnto hys commaundementes. Where vpon ſeynge that Dauid ſo wyſe a man and ſo wel learned, deſyred almigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye God ſo earneſtlye, and ſo ofte, to teache hym the vnderſtandynge of the ſcripture, and exerciſed hym ſo muche in it: it foloweth that as the true vnderſtandynge of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des worde is neceſſary for a prince, ſo it can not be had without prayer, great payne, labour and exerciſe.</p>
            <p>Then when as God commaundeth Kynges and Iudges to be learned, and learnynge can not be had with out great ſtudye and laboure, it appereth very playne that the chief labor that a noble gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhulde

Lucius the fyrſt chriſtian kynge of our lande, who ſent to Rome for Baptiſers &amp; preachers, and receaued the baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Chriſt wyth all his, after that he had receaued the chriſtian fayth, cauſed many bookes of latin to be tranſlated into hys owne naturall tonge, he alſo parted and beſtowed the day and night after this maner, he ſpent eyght houres in ſtudye and in prayer .viii. houres in hearynge of cauſes, and eyght houres in ſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge, and in ſuche neceſſary thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as were neceſſary for his bodye Picus the noble erle of Mira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dula, ſayd a very notable ſayeng, whyche I wolde al erles &amp; noble men ſhuld marke and beare awaye, and it is thys.

Thys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is about no ſmale matter, it is a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boute goddes ſeruice, and about the true doctrine religion and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pyng of God.

The one parte bryngeth forth ſcripture and the wrytten worde of God, and the other parte bryngeth forth, lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge cuſtomes, fathers, and the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of the Romyſhe churche, whyche hathe erred ſhamefully many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeres, and no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is able to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fende the contrarye. I do perceyue that ſome of you are indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and are not maryed vnto one kynde of men more then another, wherfore ye maye in theſe controuerſies, be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t iudges. But I hear ſaye that there is an other ſorte of the nobilite, that are ſo partial in theſe maters, that are nowe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, that what ſo euer reaſon or ſcripture be brought of the other parte that they fauour not, they wil not beleue it, but yet wythout any reaſon or ſcripture or any other ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficient profe, or trial of theyr doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: embrace and gladly receyue, all ſuche doctrine and tradicions as theyr choſen prophetes teache them

The ſame affectionate people, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che truſte ſo in theſe men wythout any trial of theyr doctrine whether it be good or bad, are ſo tender ouer theyr owne bodyes, that they wyll nether eare any meate nor drynke any drinke, though theyr cokes and butlers be neuer founde fautye in theyr offices in al theyr liues: except there be an aſſay take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their meat and drynke before. Yea I heare ſay that ſome dare not eate of the meat that is dreſſed of theyr co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cookes in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon kytchens, be the cokes neuer ſo honeſt men and theſe wyll neither truſte their cookes nor aſſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers and therfore eate no meate but ſuche as is dreſſed of their maidens in theyr owne preſence, in theyr owne ſecrete chambers. Wolde to God theſe loued their ſoules ſo wel, &amp; the ſoules of all them that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as they do their owne natural bodyes. As the meat of the bodye yf it be good, fedeth and noryſheth the body and ſaueth it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peryſhynge, and yf it be poyſoned it kylleth the bodye, euen ſo the doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne or preachynge whych is the food

Is it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> godly wyſedome to ſe and trye it which goeth into their bodies wyth theyr owne eyes to be good &amp; holſome before they receyue it? and to receyue of their olde goſtly cokes what ſo euer they dreſſe for them vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſene, vntaſted, and vnaſſayed? Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh their bodely cokes haue ſerued them neuer ſo longe, they wyl take nothyng that is dreſſed of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they ſe it wyth theyr owne eyes aſſayde, whye truſte they then their ſpirituall cookes ſo well that wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further aſſay or trial, recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue into theyr ſoules, what ſo euer meate they dreſſe for them &amp; gyue them? Perchance they wyl ſay that ſeculare and maried cookes, hauing wyues and chyldren, may eaſely for a brybe, be brought to poyſone their maſters and maiſtreſſes, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and vnmaryed men are more to be truſted in their ſpiritual cooke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, becauſe they are wyueleſſe and nede not to be compelled vnto poyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge for lacke of lyuinges becauſe they haue enoughe, and alſo
<pb facs="tcp:19362:44"/> by touchyng dayly the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt, are holyer then the world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly cookes are, and ſo halowed wyth the holy oyle wherwyth they were anoynted in the tyme of their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracion, that they can not kyll vs w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> poyſoned meate, as the ſecular may eaſely do. And therfore what ſo euer our ſpirituall cookes ſende vs, that is good and holſome, that wyl we re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue, wythout any further tryal.</p>
            <p>We knowe them and truſt them ſo well. To whom I anſwere that not only forein ſtories, but alſo that our owne cronicles beare wytnes, that theſe ſpirituall wyueles cookes for all their touchynge of their Chriſtes bodye dayly, and for all theyr holye oyntment, haue euen bodely poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not onely kynges and princes, but alſo dyuers other honeſt men, beſydes that I can proue, that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually they haue poyſoned many thouſandes. In the cytie of Berna, iiii. freres poyſoned a tayler wyth the poyſoned bread of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in our dayes, &amp; the ſame were burnt for their labor.

Yea &amp; a great deale more.

Aboute .xiii. yeares ago, it chaunſed that I was in Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and whylſe I was there, the prince of Salerne came thether out of Italy, wyth many noble gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. At that tyme two Englyſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:19362:54"/> frenche to, oure gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> coulde not ſpeake one worde againe to them, in any of thoſe .iii. tonges.

            <p>Nowe haue I proued by mannes learnyng goddes holy worde, and by natural reaſon, that it belongeth vnto al princes, gouernores and no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble men to be learned and by the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſcripture, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of a prince

But the moſte parte, of the noble men and gentlemen in Englande, is not learned, and doth not this theyr office which God hath appointed them.

For I haue proued before, that he is ſyck that can not do his na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural office or worke, whych nature hath appointed him to do or worke.

To be ſwelled &amp; puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp, wyth wynde and water, and to be excedyng thurſty. The fyrſte kynde called, <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> is almoſte of hole water. The ſeconde kynde cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Aſcitis,</hi> is of two partes water, and one parte wynde. The thyrde parte called, <hi>Timpanitis,</hi> is of two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes wynde, &amp; one of water, as ſome phiſicians holde. The nobilitie in my tyme haue ſwelled ſo muche, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nether theyr owne clothes, whyche they had wonte to weare, nor theyr fathers clothes, whych was as byg men as theſe be, wyll not holde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they muſte haue bygger clothes and more coſtly garmentes. Some ſwell ſo great, that they can not be content, wyth theyr fathers houſes, whych were as great men as theſe be, for theyr fathers houſe wyll not holde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for they bylde wyder hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and mo then theyr fathers dyd, for one or two wyll not holde them.

There is one knyght that hathe ten benefices in one ſhere in hys handes, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath .xxii. as credible perſones haue tolde me.

            <p>Other drinke vp the glebe lande &amp; let the reſte alone.

            <p>For he dranke vp all the monkries, freries, and nunries in Englande, he dranke vp the tenthe parte of all ſpirituall mennes lyuynges in all the hole realme. Yea and al the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytes and fyrſte fruytes of all bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyces, that fell in hys tyme, for the fyrſte yeare after that he fell in to the greate dropſye, that is, ſence the makynge of the deuelyſhe and abhominable acte of fyrſte fruites and tenthes.
